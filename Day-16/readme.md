# 1.Array

An **array** is a data structure that stores multiple values of the **same type** in a single variable, arranged in a **fixed, indexed order**, so each value can be accessed directly using its position.

Think of it like:

Many books kept in a row.
Each book has a number (index).
Whenever we want, we can pick a book directly by its number.

# 2.Why do we need Arrays?

We need arrays because they allow us to store many related values together in one place, instead of creating multiple separate variables.
This makes data easy to manage, access, and process efficiently.
